## INTRODUCTION

The Field Label Plurals module provides the ability to configure seperate field
labels for singular and plural, which are then used depending on the number of
field values.

- To submit bug reports and feature suggestions, or to track changes,
  [use the issues forum](https://drupal.org/project/issues/field_label_plurals).

## CONFIGURATION

There is no configuration for this module at present. Just install and it should
work as intended.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

- Try clearing all your caches using the performance configuration page should
  you encounter any issues.
- Edit the settings for the problematic field, using the cog/gear button, to
  flush out any invalid settings from previous versions of this module.
